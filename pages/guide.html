        <p>The project is aimed at technically savvy users who should ideally have a basic knowledge of Solid and basic data structures (for initialization).</p>
        <br>
        <h1>Preparations</h1>
        <ol start=0>
            At the current time, automatic initialization for Splitspense is not possible. Therefore the steps how this can happen are shown here. They are also shown in the video below.

            <li>Every user of Splitspense must have a Solid account. All providers are supported.</li>
            <li>There must be an administrator from a group. This administrator manages the file in which the financial expenses are documented. This administrator must create a folder with any name in his solid profile. The solid profile can be accessed
                via [webID].[provider] (e.g. https://alexh156.solidcommunity.net/). There you can reach the file structure via the second tab (folder symbol). Via the green plus and the folder symbol in the bar (second last) a new folder can be created.</li>
            <li>This folder is still private. The access rights can be managed via the lock icon next to the expanded folder. It is recommended to set yourself and all members as owner. Via the green plus and the single-male-symbol, a member can be added
                by entering the complete WebID. Each member can be classified as an owner by drag-and-drop.</li>
            <li>The actual file is created by the green plus in the folder and then the "\
                </>" icon. Name the file "splitspense.ttl" and paste the contents of this file: https://alexh156.solidcommunity.net/public/splitspense.txt
            </li>
            <li>Replace the members with the WebID abbreviations (without providers) of your members (important, otherwise it won't work). Do not put any spaces, separate the members with a simple ",". You don't have to enter anything for the history, this
                is done automatically. Click on the green checkmark to save.</li>
            <li>You are now ready to start!</li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Using Splitspense</h1>
        <ol>
            The use of Splitspense is intuitive, but is explained again in detail here.
            <li>In the first box, select your Solid provider or if not available, type it in. When you click on "Login" you should be redirected to the login page.</li>
            <li>Under the login, specify the path to the file managed by your administrator (f.e. https://alexh156.solidcommunity.net/Splitspense/splitspense.ttl). Click on "Submit". A group description, as well as the members and their account balance should
                now be displayed.</li>
            <li>In the next box you can enter an expense. In the first field comes the amount of the output, in the second the purpose (a description) and in the third field the members involved. If the expense was for the whole group, you don't need to change
                anything in the third field, otherwise specify the members involved using the WebID, separated with a comma. When you click on "Insert Expense", the new amount will be calculated for all members and the updated account balances will be
                displayed when available.</li>
            <li>In the third box it is possible to add or remove members later. Note: the member is specified using the WebID. Note: Amounts already added are not distributed to new members, just as the amounts of removed members are not distributed.</li>
            <li>The last box displays the current balances of the members, as well as a history. With the help of the "Get Balances" button, these are updated.</li>
            <li>At the bottom right you can see a button 'Reset Data'. Clicking it will ask you if you are sure. If you click ok, it will set the value of every member to 0 and delete the history.</li><br />
        </ol>

        <h1>Video example</h1>
        <ol>Following is a video for getting started, which was recorded in development. Therefore, it could look a little bit different.</ol>
